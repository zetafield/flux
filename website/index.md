title: Flux - A Minimalistic Static Site Generator
---

Flux is a minimalistic static site generator for building websites with mordern tooling.

Build sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start with a single HTML file, add CSS for styling, and include JavaScript for interactivity. Flux handles the build process while you focus on creating.

For blogs and portfolios, create reusable layouts and write content in Markdown. This approach helps you learn web development fundamentals while building real websites.

Flux encourages vanilla JavaScript over complex frameworks. If you need more advanced features, consider tools like [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Flux is built on [Vite](http://vite.dev) for fast development and optimized builds.

Output is static files that deploy anywhere - GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, AWS S3, or any VPS.

## Getting Started
