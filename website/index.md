# Flux - A Minimalistic Static Site Generator

Flux is built for folks who want to learn web fundamentals the fun way—by keeping things simple and straightforward.

We're big fans of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript here. Start with just one `.html` page—that's it! Once you've got that down, throw in some CSS to make it look amazing. Want to add some interactivity? Sprinkle in a bit of JavaScript and watch your page come to life. It's pretty cool!

Planning to build a blog or portfolio? Flux makes it easy to set up common layouts for all your pages, and you can write your content in Markdown (because who doesn't love Markdown?). This way, you'll gradually pick up all the essential web development skills. There's something really satisfying about seeing your handcrafted code turn into a real website.

Now, if you're thinking about adding React or Vue to the mix, pause for a second—do you actually need them? Sometimes vanilla JavaScript can handle what you're after. But hey, if you do need something more powerful, there are great options out there like [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Behind the scenes, we use [Vite](http://vite.dev) to make sure everything runs smoothly from development to deployment.

The best part? Everything outputs as static files, so you can deploy pretty much anywhere—GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, AWS S3, you name it!
