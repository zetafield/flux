# Flux - Simple Static Sites Made Fun!

Hey there! Flux is a minimalist static site generator built for people who love the web fundamentals – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – without all the complexity.

## Why Flux?

**Start simple, stay simple.** Begin with just one `.html` page (that's it!), add some CSS to make it gorgeous, sprinkle in JavaScript for interactivity, and watch your creation come to life. It's genuinely satisfying to see your handcrafted code become a real website!

**Perfect for blogs and portfolios.** Need recurring layouts? We've got you covered. Want to write in Markdown? Absolutely! Flux makes it super easy to organize content while you gradually build your web development skills.

**Vanilla-first mindset.** Before reaching for React or Vue, ask yourself: do you actually need them? Sometimes vanilla JavaScript handles everything you want. (But if you do need more power, check out [Astro](https://astro.build/) – it's fantastic!)

## The Technical Bits

Under the hood, we use [Vite](http://vite.dev) to make development smooth and builds lightning-fast. Everything compiles to static files, so you can deploy anywhere – GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, your own server, wherever!
