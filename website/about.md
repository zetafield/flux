# About Flux

Flux is our love letter to the simple web. We believe building websites should be fun, not frustrating!

## Our Philosophy

**Keep it simple.** The web started with HTML files, and there's still magic in that simplicity. We want to bring that back.

**Learn by doing.** Start with basics, add complexity only when you need it. Build real skills that transfer everywhere.

**Ship fast.** Less configuration, more creation. Get your ideas online quickly and iterate from there.

## Why We Built This

We got tired of wrestling with complex build tools just to create a simple blog or portfolio. The modern web toolkit is powerful, but sometimes you just want to write some HTML, style it with CSS, add a sprinkle of JavaScript, and call it a day.

Flux gives you that simplicity while still providing modern conveniences like:

- Live reloading during development
- Optimized builds for production
- Markdown support for easy writing
- Template inheritance for consistent designs

## The Team

This is a small, passionate project built by developers who remember when making websites was fun. We're not trying to solve every problem – just the ones that matter for creating great static sites.

## Get Involved
